A Smart Accessibility Interface Inspired by Real-World Innovation (as highlighted by projects featured in The Times of India)

This project is designed to empower differently-abled individuals by providing an intuitive interface to control home devices such as lights, fans, and appliances through simple touch buttons or gesture-based controls.

Inspired by accessibility-focused innovations showcased in The Times of India, this prototype demonstrates how low-cost digital solutions can dramatically improve daily independence for users facing mobility challenges.

✨ Overview

People with limited mobility often depend on caregivers for simple tasks like switching on lights or controlling fans. This prototype offers a web-based assistive interface that simulates device control without requiring physical hardware.

The solution focuses on:

Accessibility — Simple UI usable by anyone

Independence — Reduces reliance on others

Affordability — Works without additional hardware

Scalability — Future integration with IoT devices

🎯 Problem Statement

Differently-abled individuals often face difficulty performing routine tasks involving physical switches. Expensive smart-home systems are not feasible for many. There is a need for a simple, low-cost, and easy-to-use system that allows people to control household devices without physical effort.

💡 Solution

A web application that provides:

Large, accessible control buttons

Optional gesture-based triggers (simulated)

Real-time feedback (“Light ON”, “Fan OFF”, etc.)

Clean UI suitable for motor-impaired users

Mock device API to simulate IoT control

This prototype demonstrates how an inclusive digital control system could work in real life.
